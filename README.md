# VariantSync
=== automating the synchronization of software variants ===

VariantSync is an eclipse-plugin to support conventional development of a small number of software variants by introducing feature-orientation. The plugin not only considers single changes on a low code level, but also extends the granularity of changes by adapting features and feature-expressions which are known from the research area of software product-lines. VariantSync implements a strategy to synchronize features of software variants by combining low-level changes and assign them to features or feature-expressions. The goal is to synchronize features and feature-expressions between variants.
